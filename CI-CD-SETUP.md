# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Summary

## Files Created

### Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
1. **deploy-infrastructure.yml** - Creates Azure resources using Bicep templates
2. **destroy-infrastructure.yml** - Removes Azure infrastructure 
3. **deploy-application.yml** - Builds and deploys the TodoList application

### Infrastructure as Code (`infrastructure/`)
1. **main.bicep** - Azure Bicep template for App Service deployment
2. **README.md** - Comprehensive setup and usage documentation

### Code Updates
1. **Program.cs** - Added health check endpoint, static file serving, and production Swagger
2. **.gitignore** - Added CI/CD build artifact exclusions

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to configure one GitHub secret before using the workflows:

### `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
Create using Azure CLI:
```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "todolist-github-actions" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id} --sdk-auth
```

Store the complete JSON output as the secret value.

## Workflow Triggers

All workflows are **manually triggered only** (workflow_dispatch):

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Creates Azure resources in selected environment/region
2. **Destroy Infrastructure**: Safely removes infrastructure (requires "DESTROY" confirmation)  
3. **Deploy Application**: Builds and deploys both .NET backend and React frontend

## Azure Resources Created

- **Resource Group**: `rg-todolist-{environment}`
- **App Service Plan**: Basic B1 tier (Linux, ~$13/month)
- **App Service**: Linux with .NET 8.0 runtime
- **Cost**: Approximately $13/month per environment

## Deployment Architecture

```
App Service
├── Backend API (/api/*)
├── Frontend SPA (/)  
├── Swagger UI (/swagger)
└── Health Check (/health)
```

The React build output is served as static files from the .NET app's wwwroot directory.

## Validation Complete

✅ All YAML workflows are syntactically valid  
✅ Bicep template validates successfully  
✅ .NET backend builds and publishes correctly  
✅ React frontend builds successfully  
✅ Deployment package structure verified  
✅ Health check endpoint added for deployment verification

## Next Steps

1. Configure the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub secret
2. Run the "Deploy Infrastructure" workflow to create Azure resources
3. Run the "Deploy Application" workflow to deploy the TodoList application
4. Access your deployed application at the provided Azure URL

## Security & Best Practices

- HTTPS-only enforcement
- TLS 1.2 minimum version
- FTP disabled
- Secure credential storage via GitHub Secrets
- Environment isolation via resource groups
- Cost-optimized infrastructure choices
